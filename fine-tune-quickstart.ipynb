The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

The bruschetta order is far too tiny for the $9 price tag. Vintage 95 version is 3 times larger for just $3 more. Food was tasty overall, but just a little strange. Not sure what the concept is about. Wild boar and Elk--seem like odd choices for a neighborhood bar. People ordering seemed confused when told to expect really small portions. Decor is nice, but there is a strange odor--may just be newness of place and recent construction? Also, tables are too close together to fit patrons comfortably.

So I did a yelp search for salads and this popped up. Imagine my delight to find all raving reviews! I headed over immediately.\\n\\nI love the atmosphere. It's really cute and cozy, but a little industrial too with the concrete floors and counters. Love, love the teal chairs, white brick walls and fresh flowers.\\n\\nAnyway, the service, while nice, was pretty aloof. And it wasn't busy so I don't know what the deal was. Perhaps they were busy making call in lunch orders that I was ignored?\\n\\nI got a small spinach salad. For $4 I felt the portion was fair. However, my salad was supposed to come with Pomagranate and it didn't have it on there. I initially wanted to try the soup but they had run out (by noon?).\\n\\nI got a Belgian waffle for my son. My salad came out (which took awhile), I finished it and we were still waiting on the waffle. I was trying to catch the eye of one of the employees because my son was really hungry, and he's 4 so he was about to go postal.\\n\\nFinally a young girl asked of there was anything else, and I reminded her of the waffle and cookie we ordered. Her response was oh sorry that wasn't on the ticket (she was being polite not snarky - never know how that might come across in a review). But she was the one who took my order so I was confused as to how those items were left off the ticket.\\n\\nAnyway, the waffle and cookie finally came out. They were really good. In fact, the food is really good and fresh. No doubt about that.\\n\\nBut my overall experience was just weird. In fact on the way out, a gentleman asked how was everything and I was like ok, food was good but it took a long time and the Pomagranate was left off my salad. His response, were there pomagranates supposed to be on your salad? I was like yeah all the ingredients of the salad are right here on the menu. He just shrugged his shoulders and said yeah it happens sometimes. He wasn't rude, but dismissive. Didn't apologize or anything.\\n\\nAs I walked out, one of the ladies was rolling out dough to make cinnamon rolls.

I've been to Wolfgang's express restaurant in Walt Disneyworld, but I think even that food was more appetizing then what I had in Lupo!\\n\\nI don't mean to be rude, but this food was in no way what I expected. I came here with my sisters and cousin on a Saturday night, and the place was full of people, the lights were dim, the tables were white and fancy, and then... a waiter came and plopped two bread sticks in the middle of the table. Didn't even say a word. Not even a basket. Just two hard, long, and completely dry bread sticks wrapped in one napkin and placed in the middle of the table. So, my sisters and cousin and I were just wondering what to do with the sticks, and tried looking around the other tables to see if other people had eaten theirs. Many people still had their sticks.\\n\\nAfter several minutes of confusion and eating tiny pieces of the mystery bread sticks, we finally received a REAL basket of REAL bread that came with some garlic sauce and balsamic vinegar + olive oil. That was much better, but still not as good (I thought) as the bread I had in Maggiano's. Weird.\\n\\nSo, we ordered our food. Let's just say, it was hardly worth the price. Here's what we ordered (I'm condensing the names because those names on the menu were in Italian and ridiculously long):\\n\\n- Halibut ($31): Gah. Overcooked, or something. Definitely was more bland than I expected. The fish was placed on top of a bed of sloppily put-together tomatoes that were sauteed (I'm guessing) with onions and other things. Together, it tasted worst than something I could've done at home with the same ingredients. In fact, the sauce under the fish was watery, and way overcooked. Hardly in tact and the pesto sauce? Ah! Didn't even taste it! NOT worth $31! Look at my picture for how terrible the plating was.\\n\\n- Salmon ($30): Best thing I tried. The salmon was pretty good -- I liked the extra crunch it had, but I wasn't sure if that was on purpose or if it was a bit overcooked. Tthe side potatoes were just that: side potatoes. Very salty, no herbs -- just like french fries that weren't cut into fries yet. Eh.\\n\\n- Fettucini with truffles (Mushroom pasta) ($26): The fettucini was undercooked, lathered in oil and topped with salt. It was paired with truffles, but that didn't make up for the extremely unnecessary amount of oil it had. Had an odd mix of flavor that did not want me to eat any more than the few bites I had. My sisters agreed, only finishing the plate because of its expensive price.\\n\\n- Shrimp risotto ($29): Perhaps the item I disliked the most. The risotto was way too creamy and buttery, and did not pair well with the shrimp. I do admit, though, the shrimps were good. But, yeah, I couldn't even eat three bites of this. Just did not like it (except for the shrimp).\\n\\nI'll say this, though -- the service was pretty good. My sister blew out the candle on our table, and it was replaced instantly. We always got water refills, too. But, it was weird because a different person always came to our table. Different waiters. In fact, there were only waiters, no waitresses. Either way, I think service was decent, but the food just was not worth the $94 total plus $10 tip that we paid.\\n\\nThank God we had a 25% discount by showing them our tickets from The Lion King show! I would hate to pay full price for this!\\n\\nDo not come here if you're looking for good eats (unless you greatly enjoy oil and salt)!</td>\n",
