I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

It tends to be loud and crowded and the service is a little spotty.  \\n\\nMid-summer visits can be iffy.  The misters can't be on outside after the sun goes down...apparently this makes the patio slippery, but, frankly, it also makes the patio really, really hot, especially if the misters are on when you're seated and then turned off a few minutes later.  They also sometimes list items on the menu long after they've actually discontinued them (the ground ahi burger is an example - the server said: oh, we haven't carried that for ages).\\n\\nOver all, a fun place to meet friends and hang out, if you don't mind waiting a bit for service, bumping into people, and gettting pretty hot on summer nights.</td>\n",

She made sure I was ordering exactly what I wanted (and asked me if I wanted the authentic Chinese recipe- of course I do!) Then, she offered to have it ready in ten minutes, or hold the order until a time of my choosing.\\n\\nI got there and met the nice lady who took my order, who immediately recognized me. She greeted me, and I paid in cash, receiving a  small discount! The entire time, she was smiling and making me feel very welcome. She gave me my food, which was all ready to go, and said \\\"enjoy, it's all nice and hot.\\\" A huge component of my job is customer service, and this experience was A+ customer service.\\n\\nOf course, as we all know, the food was amazing! My \\\"lunch\\\" portion for $7 was enough food for me to fill up now, and still save half for whenever I want it later. I've been around to the other Chinese restaurants in the area that have very good reviews, and they are good, but not quite as good as the Golden Harbor.\\n\\nThe only negative point is that it is hard for me to justify ordering the same thing I always get each time, as I know whatever I order will be fantastic!</td>\n",

They were gracious enough to bring some sweet potato sticks, kimchee, and pickled red cabbage for us to try. The Hawaiian bento is both delicious and hearty. The service was excellent. The location is semi hidden on the other side of Baja Taco which is visible from the street. Looking forward to coming back again and again to try more delicious creations. I was allowed to peek at a sample of the dinner menu before they finalized it as they were only open for lunch during the first week of operation and it looks very dynamic. Plan to try more of the lunch menu and have dinner here as well. The atmosphere is perfect for a hip lunch crowd and decor suits a late night foodie club complete with k-pop videos playing on screens throughout the dining area.

Obviously, they pack in the patients like sardines,. That should have been our first clue about this organization. We filled out our medical forms and waited. When we saw Dr. Lin, we were rushed because she had a procedure pending, which of course was more money than a simple office visit. She talked to my fiance about his problems for a few minutes and did a needless biospsy, which later scarred him. When I wanted to ask her some questions, she left abruptly and we waited for fifteen minutes for her return. She never came back. Someone else handed us a useless prescription for a wrong diagnosis. I called the office the next day and asked if they charged my insurance and they said \\\"yes.\\\" I was furious since Dr. Lin was abrupt and didn't examine me. I did get one question answered about a mole on one arm, but she didn't ever treat me as a patient, yet charged my insurance for her services. \\n\\nI tried to get in touch with the office manager which took ten days. She was rude and finally called me back, but didn't listen, only made snide remarks. I mentioned that I have been a nurse for over twenty years and that Dr. Lin definitely needed to improve her bedside manner and her educational skills. My fiance has two scars from the biopsy taken mouths ago. My insurance paid her money and billed me $30.00, which is a joke. \\n\\nI tried to reason with an unfriendly and rude office, but they didn't seem to care. She never once called to talk about the problem. Too busy I guess to care about her patients. No surprise.
